GEAR tokens were awarded over multiple community distribution stages, each with their own rules and amounts. The early stages of testers and Discord participants can be found in the [general docs](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/launch-phases). Other stages and GEAR distirbution have been attributed to retroactive and ongoing [Liquidity Mining](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-22-gearbox-v2-liquidity-mining-programs/1550), those details can be seen here. [GEAR](https://docs.gearbox.finance/gear-token/gear-overview) information is also accessible in docs.
